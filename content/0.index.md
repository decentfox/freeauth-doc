  EdgeDB * FastAPI

  [EdgeDB](https://edgedb.com), a graph-relational database, is one of the most disruptive technologies these years. Using its own query language, EdgeQL, developers can implement most business logic in the database. Based on EdgeDB and FastAPI, FreeAuth offers a highly efficient backend development experience.

  Login Box Customization

  From your brand logo to the primary color, customize almost everything about your login box - all without writing any new code. To improve security, allow users to authenticate with SMS or email as their second authentication factor, and more ways will be released in the future.

  Role-Based Access Control
  #description
  To implement dynamic access control, assign permissions to users based on their roles within an organization, which creates a simple, manageable approach to access management that is less prone to error than assigning permissions to users individually.

  Single Sign On (on the way)
  #description
  Single Sign On will be released in the next version. It allows users to simply log in once and use all applications they have been granted access to. By then, FreeAuth can be seen as an independent public service to provide authentication and authorization for multiple applications.
